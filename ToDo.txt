Features to be added, in no special order:

1. Fix search so that columns may be sorted while maintaining subset containing search records. 
2. Add role-based user authentication so that authors of tips can add, delete and modify their own tips.
3. Add documentation, so others can understand, fork, contribute, and comment on design and features.
4. Add Home page, explain that questions should be posted to the ruby-talk mailing list/not to the author's email accounts.
5. Consider deployment to Heroku and determine what costs might be involved initially and in the future.
