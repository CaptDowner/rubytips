          <td>Over the last couple of years, I have been collecting what I consider 
              the best advice posted to the Ruby-Talk list into a mail 
              folder of mine called Ruby Talk Tips. Since I feel that I have been the 
              beneficiary of the advice posted there, I thought a way of giving back 
              might be to release an open source Rails application featuring the 
              best tips I have collected thus far from the Ruby-Talk list.

          <td><b>Note:</b> These tips have been selected by me and represent messages that I found to 
              be useful or informative about Ruby and Ruby on Rails. This is not a complete list, nor 
              does it necessarily contain the <b>BEST</b> nor the most accurate advice. By releasing it 
              to the community, the hope is that this list of tips can be used, enlarged, and improved by 
              the Ruby and Rails communities, which can make us all better programmers and bring even more 
              understanding and clarity to this language we've all grown to love. I have taken the liberty 
              of condensing the email tips  by removing greetings, signatures and other content not directly 
              relevant to the tip content. I have added keywords to each tip so that searches can be
              quick and relevant.

              Klemme was the largest single tip contributor on my list (141 tips and counting), 
              and the accuracy and quality of the tips he provides demonstrate his expertise along with 
              his willingness to share his knowledge. Special contributors 
              include folks like Ryan Davis, Brian Candler, Jesus Gabriel Galan, Josh Cheek, 
              and the contributor known as 7stud, all of whom have 10 or more tips
              that have been selected for the RubyTalkTips list. 
              Other deserving contributors include longtime community members such as James Edward Gray II, 
              David A. Black, Jake Kaiden, Jan E., Intransition, Hassan Schroeder, and Chad Perrin.
