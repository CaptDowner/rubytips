<h1>RubyTalkTips (-v tbd) will be released soon!</h1>

Over the last couple of years, I have been collecting what I consider 
to be the best of the advice posted to the Ruby-Talk list into a mail 
folder of mine called Ruby Tips. Since I feel that I have been the 
beneficiary of the advice posted there, I thought a way of giving back 
might be to release an open source RoR application featuring the 536
best tips I have collected thus far from the Ruby-Talk list.</td>

<tr>
<td><b>Note:</b> These tips have been selected by me and represent messages that I found to 
be useful or informative about Ruby and Ruby on Rails. This is not a complete list, nor 
does it necessarily contain the <b>BEST</b> nor the most accurate advice. By releasing it 
to the community, the hope is that this list of tips can be used, enlarged, and improved by 
the Ruby and RoR communities, which can make us all better prgorammers and bring even more 
understanding and clarity to this language we've all grown to love.

<tr></tr>
<tr>
<td>I have taken the liberty of condensing the email tips  by removing
greetings, signatures and other content not directly relevant to the 
tip content. I have added keywords to each tip so that searches can be
quick and relevant.
